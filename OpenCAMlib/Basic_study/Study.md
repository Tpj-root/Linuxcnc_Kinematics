**point.cpp**




* `Point();`
  Creates a point at the origin `(0, 0, 0)`.

* `Point(double x, double y, double z);`
  Creates a point with coordinates `(x, y, z)`.

* `Point(double x, double y);`
  Creates a point with coordinates `(x, y, 0)`, assuming `z = 0`.

* `Point(const Point &p);`
  Copy constructor: creates a new point by copying the coordinates of an existing point `p`.





Explanation of the copy constructor `Point(const Point &p)`:

* **Purpose:**
  It creates a new `Point` object by copying the values from an existing `Point` object `p`.

* **How it works:**
  When you write something like:

  ```cpp
  Point p1(1, 2, 3);
  Point p2 = p1;  // copy constructor called here
  ```

  The copy constructor is invoked to create `p2` as a duplicate of `p1`.

* **Why use a const reference?**

  * `const Point &p` means the original object `p` is passed by reference (no copy made), which is more efficient.
  * `const` means the copy constructor promises not to modify `p`.

* **Typical implementation:**

  ```cpp
  Point(const Point &p) {
      x = p.x;
      y = p.y;
      z = p.z;
  }
  ```

  It copies the internal state (coordinates) from `p` to the new object.

* **When is it called?**

  * When an object is initialized from another object of the same type.
  * When an object is passed by value to a function.
  * When an object is returned by value from a function.

In short, it ensures a proper, safe copy of the objectâ€™s data to avoid unexpected sharing or modification.





```cpp
double Point::dot(const Point &p) const {
    return x * p.x + y * p.y + z * p.z;
}
```

### Explanation:

* **`Point::dot`**:
  This is a member function of the `Point` class named `dot`.

* **`const Point &p`**:
  The function takes a reference to another `Point` object `p` as input, without copying it (`&`), and guarantees not to modify it (`const`).

* **`const` at the end**:
  This means the function itself does not modify the current object (`this`).

* **What it computes:**
  It calculates the **dot product** of the current point and the point `p`.

* **Dot product formula:**
  For two points (or vectors) $(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2, z_2)$,

  $$
  \text{dot product} = x_1 \times x_2 + y_1 \times y_2 + z_1 \times z_2
  $$

* **Return value:**
  A `double` which is the dot product scalar result.

### In short:

This function returns the dot product between the current point and another point `p`.
